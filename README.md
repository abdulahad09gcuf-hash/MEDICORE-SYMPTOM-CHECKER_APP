# 🩺 medicore  Symptom Checker Mobile Application

### *(Flutter-Based Healthcare Decision Support System)*

---

## 📌 Abstract

The **Symptom Checker Mobile Application** is a Flutter-based healthcare support system designed to assist users in performing a **preliminary symptom-based health assessment**.
The application collects user-reported symptoms and provides **possible diagnoses and basic recommendations** using predefined medical logic.

This project serves as a **prototype decision-support tool** and a **foundation for future AI-driven medical diagnostic systems**.

> ⚠️ **Medical Disclaimer:**
> This application is intended **only for educational and research purposes** and does **not** replace professional medical consultation.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many regions, especially low-resource settings, access to immediate medical guidance is limited. Users often rely on unverified internet sources for symptom interpretation, which can lead to misinformation.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This application provides:

* A **structured symptom input system**
* **Logic-based diagnosis results**
* Clear **health advice and precautions**
* A scalable architecture ready for **AI/ML integration**
